## FastQC

From [FastQC
website](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/):
"FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks
on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing
pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to
give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which
you should be aware before doing any further analysis. "

This is a useful program that performs some of the basic diagnostics
on a FASTQ sequence file, looking for common issues that could appear
in your libraries.

First we would download the FastQC program:

If you are using a PC or Linux, you can download it
  [here](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.9.zip)
* Unzip the file, and open the FastQC folder
* Doubleclick on run_fastqc.bat

If you are using a Mac, you can download it [here](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.9.dmg)
* Doubleclick on the downloaded DMG file to open it
* Doubleclick on the FastQC app
  * The first time that you are opening this, you may need to hold
  down the "control" key, right-click on the FastQC app, and click "Open"
